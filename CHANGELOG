* Bugfix: Special value ":" should not be typed with double. In Data.java now properly checked.
* Also, GAE would not allow Java 6, anymore. Thus, downloaded Java GAE 1.7.7 from http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/downloads/detail?name=appengine-java-sdk-1.7.7.zip&can=1&q=
** Was compatible to previous versions.

* Had to comment out Filter for Compress Gzip.Filter in web.xml, otherwise system would not run. Apparently, 
com.ontologycentral.estatwrap.webapp.GzipFilter is not existing (any more?).
* why so complicated redirecting? Changed link of dsd "../dsd/tec00114#dsd" to "/dsd/tec00114#dsd" and in IdentifierServlet from "../" to "/".
* had to create nuts.txt myself since it did not exist
* For data, set base "", so that also debuggable on localhost.
* Add English label
* Aggregations cannot be calculated if measure does not get a range and measure
values do not get a datatype, since default datatype is string.
* For properly modelled codeList, I had to add every concept to the scheme via inScheme.
