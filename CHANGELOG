* Had to comment out Filter for Compress Gzip.Filter in web.xml, otherwise system would not run. Apparently, 
com.ontologycentral.estatwrap.webapp.GzipFilter is not existing (any more?).
* why so complicated redirecting? Changed link of dsd "../dsd/tec00114#dsd" to "/dsd/tec00114#dsd" and in IdentifierServlet from "../" to "/".
* had to create nuts.txt myself since it did not exist
* For data, set base "", so that also debuggable on localhost.
* Add English label
* Aggregations cannot be calculated if measure does not get a range and measure
values do not get a datatype, since default datatype is string.
* For properly modelled codeList, I had to add every concept to the scheme via inScheme.
